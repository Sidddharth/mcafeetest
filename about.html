                    When it comes to technical support, it can be a frustrating experience for 
                    many. The popular players in the industry are charging through the nose just 
                    for a “diagnostic”. In other words, they are charging you high rates just to 
                    look at your issue. Solving it, well, that’s another story altogether.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    mcafeecard.com realized that what people really want is someone who they 
                    can call to have their issue resolved for a reasonable price. No diagnostic 
                    fees, labor fees, additional fees, or any other hidden fees. It’s just one 
                    simple low flat rate . We also understand that technology can be challenging 
                    at times and we want to assure our customers and potential customers that we 
                    are here to listen to you. In fact, that is where the mcafeecard.com name 
                    comes from; talk to us.
